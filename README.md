#1. First, we estimated the R0 for the given Hong Kong Influnenza data from the file dat0.csv. The R code is in the para_est.Rmd file.

#2. Second, we simulate the Influenza epidemic using the estimated R0 from the exponential growth phase. The R code is in the final_project_est_exp_R0.Rmd file.

#3. Third, we simulate the Influenza epidemic using the estimated R0 from the MLE. The R code is in the final_project_est_MLE_R0.Rmd file.

#4. Fourth, we simulate the Influenza epidemic using the R0 provided from the article. The R code is in the final_project_obt_R0.Rmd file.
