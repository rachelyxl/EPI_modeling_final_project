# Part 3, Assume a generation time of 3.5 days, estimate R0 from the exponential growth phase of the epidemic (try the first 12, 34, and 50 days), using the following equation:
# Report your R0 estimates for the three time periods (i.e., the first 7, 14, and 21 days)
```{r}
# EXAMPLE: FOR THE FIRST 11 DAYS
# Fit to the data during the first 11 days:
D = 3.5; # set the generation time to 3.5 days
Ndays = 12;  # ADJUST THE NUMBER OF DAYS INCLUDED IN THE FIT HERE

# Part 5, estimate R0 use MLE method - the serial interval is obtain from the paper: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3057478/#:~:text=The%20serial%20interval%20is%20the,(from%20infection%20to%20symptoms).

```{r}
# load the library for MLE
library(R0)

# First we need the distribution of generation time (i.e. serial interval)
mGT<-generation.time("gamma", c(3.6, 1.6))

# EXAMPLE: FOR THE FIRST 7 DAYS
# Maximum Likelihood Estimation using the est.R0.ML function
est.R0.ML(df$real_flu_case, # the data
          mGT, # the distribution of serial interval
          begin=1, # the start of the data

          range=c(0.01,50) # the range of possible values to test
          )

# EXAMPLE: FOR THE FIRST 33 DAYS
# Maximum Likelihood Estimation using the est.R0.ML function
